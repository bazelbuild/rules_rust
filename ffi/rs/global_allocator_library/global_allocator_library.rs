// Workaround for Rust issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73632
// We provide the allocator functions that rustc leaves in rlibs. These are
// normally provided by rustc during the linking phase (since the allocator in
// use can vary), but if rustc doesn't do the final link we have to provide
// these manually. Hopefully we can make progress on the above bug and
// eventually not need this kludge.
//
// Recently rustc started mangling these symbols, so we rewrote them in
// rust.
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/127173
//
// This code uses unstable internal rustc features that are only available when
// using a nightly toolchain. Also, it is only compatible with versions
// of rustc that include the symbol mangling, such as nightly/2025-04-08 or
// later.
//
// This has been translated from our c++ version
// rules_rust/ffi/cc/global_allocator_library/global_allocator_library.cc.
