# BUILD files for crates that require additional targets to be linked from their
# source files.  Some build.rs scripts go through the process of building c or
# c++ libraries that are thing linked as native libraries.
#
# Cargo raze supports adding additional content to the end of the autogenerated
# BUILD file using "additional_build_file".
#
# https://docs.rs/cargo-raze/0.3.1/cargo_raze/settings/struct.CrateSettings.html#structfield.additional_build_file
#
# Using this, we can add additional targets to that package.  The main target
# for the crate can then depend on these extra targets using the crate's
# "additional_deps" cargo raze crate property.
#
# https://docs.rs/cargo-raze/0.2.15/cargo_raze/settings/struct.CrateSettings.html#structfield.additional_deps
#
# See //third_party/cargo/Cargo.toml for the usage.
